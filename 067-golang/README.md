## [Problem 67](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67)

Language: go version go1.14.1 linux/amd64

This is technically a repeated language, but that's because its a repeated question. Problem 67 is the same as 18, its just not brute force-able. My solution for 18 and 67 are the same.

The makefile copies/runs/removes that solution from its directory to here.

##### Requires

- [`go`](https://golang.org/)
